How To Build The NeXT ROM Monitor From Sources
Release 0.8.30
ROM CRC 0x75cb568c
PROM Programmer Checksum 0x40f8
John Seamons  12/01/88

This note describes how to build a binary and S-record file
of the NeXT ROM monitor from the golden master source media.
Like any other application, you must build on a machine that
contains the 0.8 release and the associated include files
(in /usr/include).

1)  Mount the golden master source media as a Unix filesystem
on the machine you'll be building on (have to be superuser to do this).
	# mount /dev/od0a /mnt

2)  Go to the ROM configuration directory.
	# cd /mnt/rom-0.8.30/conf

NOTE: If you just want to build the ROM from sources without
altering the basic configuration then skip the next two steps.

3)  (optional) Inspect the configuration file "RELEASE" and
make any required changes (like enabling certain options or
changing the version numbers).
	# cd conf
	# <edit> RELEASE

4)  (optional) Configure in the changes you have made.
	# config RELEASE
	# cd ..

5)  Go to the build directory and start a build.
	# cd RELEASE
	# make clean
	# make

6)  The "make" should complete without errors.  Observe the
size of the object file shown.  The size under the "dec"
column must be <= 65536 to fit in a 27C512 PROM.
	text	data	bss	dec	hex
	38840	26588	12	65440	ffa0

7)  Build the S-record files for the ROMulator and PROM
programmer.  The file "mon.srec" is used with the "load"
command to download a ROMulator.  The file "mon.prom" is
an S-record file with shorter (2 byte) address fields required
by the Data I/O PROM programmers.  
	# ../srec/srec mon >mon.srec
	# ../srec/srec -2 mon >mon.prom

8)  Use your local procedure to download the PROM programmer and
burn PROM parts.  The Data I/O programmer checksum should indicate
0x40f8 for this release.  This checksum should not be confused
with the ROM release CRC that the ROM computes and verifies
internally at power on time.
