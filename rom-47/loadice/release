			  RELEASE NOTES

			LoadICE Version 1.4b

This is a new release of the LoadICE software.  We have tried to fix all
known bugs and also ported and tested the software on Macintosh, UNIX and
VMS systems.  This code was compiled under MicroSoft C V6.0.

***************************************************************************
FOR MAC MPW USERS: To make life a little easier and sane, we have added
a filter to each interactive input so that you can now type the input
on the same line as the prompts from the program.  The software will 
filter out the prompt string and read your input.  We have very loose
format checking so try not to backspace over the prompt or otherwise
put your input else where.  The software is certainly more fun to use now!!
We also made the BeachBall cursor spin around while loading the unit etc.
***************************************************************************

The following command is added to the dialog mode

    b                 - toggle Bus Req/Bus Ack mode on and off. 

Bus Request mode only works with the bus request and bus acknowledge 
signal lines connected to the target. It allows the user to modify the
code without disrupting the target system. If you have any questions 
please call Grammar Engine.

We have increased the number of files that can be specified in the .INI
file from 15 to 55. Any line in the .INI file that starts with a * is now
parsed as a comment.

We have also added to the edit mode.
